I am Matteo Posenato, I have a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Padua. 
This paper contains the most significant projects I did during university and my path is organised in several projects, each one for a different field of application, algorithm optimisation, time series data analysis, machine learning project and MLT which is the biggest project, i.e. my thesis.
there are basically four projects:
1. MLT: natural language processing project in which we study in detail the multitask mutual learning technique for sentiment analysis and topic detection.
2. Car_project: in this project my colleagues and I analyse the effect of CO2 emissions with respect to different types of cars in five European countries over the years.
3. Project_emojy: This is my first Natural Language Processing project in which we categorise sentiment in different texts through emoji.
4. Boosting as Franke-Wolfe: is an optimisation project in which my colleagues and I analyse the impact of different Franke-Wolfe algorithms as update rules in boosting algorithms.
