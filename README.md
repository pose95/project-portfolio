This reposity contains the meaningful projects that i did during university and my way, is organize in different project aech one for different apllication field, optimization of the algorithm, analysis of time series data, machine learning project and MLT that is the
bigger project, is my degree thesis.
the project are basically four:
1. MLT: Natural Language Processing project in which we study in detailed the Multitask Mutual Learning technique for sentiment analysis and topic detection
2. Project_cars: in this project me and my collegues analyze the effect of CO2 emissions in five Europeans countries during the Years.
3. Project_emojy: is my first project in Natural Language Processing in which we categorize the sentiment in the differents text trough the emoji
4. Boosting as Franke-Wolfe: is an optimization project in which me and my collegues analyze the impact of differents Franke-Wolfe algorithms as update rules in the boosting algorithms.  
I'm Matteo Posenato, i have a master Degree in Data Science from Univeristy of Padua.
