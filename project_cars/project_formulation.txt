TITLE: Effects of CO2 Emissions on the purchase of cars

problem: we decided to analyse the effect of CO2 emissions in the car purchase market.
We want to try to understand whether data on greenhouse gas emissions, and the resulting climate change, can influence people's purchasing choices.
Once we understand whether there is a relationship between the two, we want to try to predict future purchases using analysis models.
